 * ForWhat: One day, Jack was going home by tram. When he got his ticket,
 * he noticed that number on the ticket was not lucky. A lucky ticket is
 * a six-digit number on the ticket in which sum of the first three digits
 * is equal to the sum of the last three digits.
 * For example, number 165912 is lucky because sum of 1+6+5=12, and
 * 9+1+2=12.
 * Since the number on the ticket wasn't lucky, Jack needs your help to find
 * the next lucky ticket number.
 * For example, if Jack's ticket number is 165901, then the next lucky ticket
 * number is 165903.
 * Given Jack's current ticket number, find and print the next lucky ticket
 * number.
