 * ForWhat: Two cats named A and B are standing at integral points on the x-axis.
 * Cat A is standing at point x and cat B is standing at point y. Both cats run
 * at the same speed, and they want to catch a mouse named C that's hiding at
 * integral point z on the x-axis. Can you determine who will catch the mouse?
 * You are given q queries in the form of x, y, and z. For each query, print the
 * appropriate answer on a new line:
 * If cat A catches the mouse first, print Cat A.
 * If cat B catches the mouse first, print Cat B.
 * If bot cats reach the mouse at the same time, print Mouse C as the two cats
 * fight and mouse escapes.
